MateInOne - 150 checkmate problems.

Recently I built my first Android application "MateInOne". Mate in one is a collection of 150 checkmate problems in one move. I decided to create this app to enrich my knowledge in Android and to motivate my son to solve chess problems every day. The main feature of this app - it has special option when you child can play computer games or surf  the internet only after solving several chess problems.
 
Parents can set how often and how many chess problems their child have to solve before he can use the tablet or phone. For example: solve 10 problems per day. Of course parents can skip solving by entering password. Also it is possible to set number of attempts to solve one chess problem. You can get information about number of attempts and number of successfully solved problems.

 	 	 
The application not only check your solution, but also can find a possible next move of  the opponent if you have failed.
This application has 2D graphic. Chess pieces and button icons are drawn using true-type fonts. In app there are two ways to move a chess piece - you can drag it around the screen and drop it at a new position or just touch the chess piece and then touch one of possible squares. Video of this game is available here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmKf8dmVdeY.

I would be very grateful for any comments or remarks concerning my app, it is available here https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.rubanevgeniya.mylockscreen.
